# TensorFlow_DeepLearning_CNN_CPU_GPU_Bencharmk_Test
## Tested Environment:
    Tensorflow 2.17
    Ryzen 3900
    GPU 3090
## Code Flow
    Load the MNST Image Data (to classify number 0 to 9)
    Define Deep learning model - CNN (Convolution Neuro Network) 
    Training the Model in CPU and GPU separately
    Compare the time used by CPU and GPU
